ngPAWS authoring system
=======================

ngPAWS (pronunced n-g-paws) is an authoring system based on the Professional Adventure Writing System, thus the name ngPAWS stands for "next generation PAWS". 

PAWS was an authoring system widely used in UK and Spain in the later 80s and early 90s, being the version for Sinclair ZX Spectrum the most well known, though there have been  version for CP/M (Amstrad CPC, PCW) and IBM PC. Also, there are several clones of PAW 
made in the 90s, 2000, and 2010s.

What makes ngPAWS different?
----------------------------
What makes ngPAWS different is it does not generate an executable file, but a website that can be run in any modern browser. So text adventures (aka interactive fiction) made with ngPAWS can be run in any web server, or locally.
