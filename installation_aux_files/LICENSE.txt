The compiler was developed first by Yokiyoki for his PAW clone "Paguaglús", it has been modified during the years by me (Carlos Sanchez) for the Superglus project and now I have adapted it to generate javascript instead of glulx assembler. It's (C) Yokiyoki and Carlos Sanchez and it's released under the the GPL v2 or later license.

The IDE is developed by Carlos Sánchez, and it's released under the GPL v2 or later license.

The jsl libraries all can be used in your games, so they all use the more flexible MIT license. All of them are (C) Carlos Sánchez.

Please take all these licenses in mind when creating yout text adventure.
